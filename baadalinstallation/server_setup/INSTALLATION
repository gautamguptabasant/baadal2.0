1. make utils
   This will fetch all the required installers and the ubuntu ISO

2. make switch LIBVIRT_INSTALL=yes VIRTMANAGER_INSTALL=yes
   This will setup the internal bridges on the sandbox machine. These
   arguments reinstall libvirt and virtmanager -- this may be required
   if the machine has old versions of these programs.

3. make baadal-transfer-tar
   This will create a ~/.baadal/utils/baadal.tar file, which is to be
   transferred to all the VMs. If an old version of baadal.tar exists, and
   you want to replace it with a new one (because you think that something
   has changed), type 'make clean-transfer-tar' before this command.

6. make pxe 
   This will create the PXE and DHCP VM. Once the VM is created, it is required to update the dhcp.conf file from the already running dhcp server.

7. Go to the PXE DHCP machine and execute below commands 
   $  cd /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/server_setup/
   $  make openvswitch 
   $  make pxe_dhcp-setup

   $  cd  /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/
   $  ./dhcp_installation.sh
   $  ./pxe_installation.sh

8. make cfengine
   This will create the cfengine VM.

#change the value of CFENGINE_IP and CONTROLLER_IP in controller_installation.cfg file
9. Go to the cfengine VM and execute below commands
   $  cd /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/server_setup/
   $  make openvswitch

   $  cd  /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/
   $  ./cfengine_installation.sh

10. make mysql
 This will create the mysql VM

11. Go to the mysql VM and execute the below commands
   $  cd /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/server_setup/
   $  make openvswitch

Before executing the below script take the mysqldump of the baadal db from the machine where mysql is currently executing.
Use the below command to take the mysqldump ,
mysqldump -uroot -p<PASSWORD> baadal > dumpfile.sql and keep the file in /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/ folder 

   $  cd  /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/
   $  ./mysql_installation.sh

12. make controller
13. Go to the controller VM and execute the below commands
   $  cd /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/server_setup/
   $  make openvswitch
   $  cd /baadal/baadal/baadalinstallation/server_setup/controller
   $  ./controller_newinstallation.sh
